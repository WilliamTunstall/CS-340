How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?


I was able to write programs that were maintainable, readable, and adaptable, by using simple industry standards such as using pseudocode and writing clean code while including notes that explain or organize my code. Using a sort of "top-down" approach really allowed me to evaluate problems and find thorough solutions to the coding problems I faced. Again, thinking with a 'top-down" approach, I can use the CRUD module as a guide when I face a similar problem. Using this foundation will make it easier for me to focus on finer details when it comes to newer and more complex problems.

Similar to the previous question, I think now that I am further along in this degree I am looking at these problems from a Top-Down point of view, where we start we bigger details such as the client's requirements and desires and slowly work down to smaller design choices. I don't think I went into as much detail when looking into the design of the project in this class, but I used pseudocode and the professor's directions to understand the big ideas before moving on to the smaller ideas. This project was the first time I used frontend code in conjunction with more backend code. This code was sort of an introduction into full-stack for me and it made it harder to sow in the smaller details.


We computer scientists work in conjunction with other scientists, artists, businessmen, and clients to create applications. Our clients have visions for certain applications that provide a service, entertainment, or education. Many, if not most, of our clients do not have the coding expertise, so we bring into fruition the applications that support their ideas, services, etc, in the most efficient, cost-effective, and most desired way possible.
